# Deep_learning--Spam_Detector--AT-T

Fictive project completed as part of my Data Scientist Training with jedha Bootcamp (Paris)

## Project 🚧

One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Goals 🎯
The goal for this project is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.
